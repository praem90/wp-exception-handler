# wp-exception-handler
A single file plugin to catch and print Worpress exceptions and errors for debugging


Its difficult to see debug.log too know what is the exception while working on a plugin development. 
I feel like if I'm able to see the exception at the time it rises would increase my productivity.

Finally this plugin comes. A lot to improve but at any point we have to start it.
